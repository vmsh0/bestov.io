## Who I am

Nice to meet you! I'm Riccardo Paolo Bestetti, a software developer & a musician.

What defines me is my obsessive curiosity: whenever I see something I feel the urge to deconstruct it and understand how the parts works together to give act to the thing itself.

I have a BSc from a small local university, and a Double Master's Degree in Embedded Systems and I&E at KTH Stockholm and Universit√† di Trento.

## What I do

You can see a small subset of the projects I worked on in the Projects section of the website.

My past work experiences go from administrating computer networks, to working as a software architect, to teaching
mathematics and computer science to high school and university students. I have a keen interest in embedded computing
and love the challenge of working with constraints. I also love reverse engineering, and I am in the process of
gathering more knowledge and experience in it.

I have contributed to various Open Source projects, including CraftBukkit (now maintained by [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)), the [Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8ff978b8b222bc9d51dd109a46b51026336c95d8&noprocess), and [Duplicati](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/pull/4661). For more details, you can visit the [Open Source](/open-source) page.

My musical experience comprises playing guitar as a soloist and in various ensembles and orchestras. I also currently play guitar  in a theater band for a show called "La Mia Trinacria", by actor and writer Giuseppe Sinatra. It is a musical about a Sicilian immigrant to Northern Italy who is going back to visit his Sicilian relatives, with many fun and grotesque stories and traditional songs reinterpreted as Rock pieces.
