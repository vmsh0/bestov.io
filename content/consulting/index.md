# Academic tutoring

I have extensive tutoring experience in a range of high-school STEM subjects, as well as university subjects
(programming, databases, computer architecture, computer networks, operating systems, etc). I have a proven track
record, having taught to 20+ different one-to-one students of different ages and programmes, in Italian and English.

I myself went through university recently, with a BSc in Computer Science and a mobility-based MSc in I&E and
Embedded Systems at KTH Stockholm and Università di Trento.

I can offer the following tutoring services:

* I can help you make general sense of a subject you're struggling with, and make a plan to improve and pass the exam
* I can tutor you on specific parts of subject programmes
* I can help you with homework and projects

I will not complete your homework for you; please, do not ask! I generally do not offer help with thesis work, but you
can ask and I'm generally happy to hear about what you're working on.

I only offer tutoring remotely. My rate for tutoring is 75€ per 50 minutes; I am sometimes willing to offer lower
rates to people in need. Please refer to the contact information at [About me]({{< ref "/about-me" >}} "About me") to
discuss your needs.
